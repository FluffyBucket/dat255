# App: Mentorite

##Introduction
We have created an app to help newly arrived people in sweden to get a contact with someone that have already setteld in.

##Installation 
Download the .apk file in builds folder. The builds folder can be found in the root directory.
Install the apk file on your phone.


##Usage
When you first start the app you will be going through a first time setup where you will set up your profile.
The steps will be:
- If you will be a mentor or newly arrived.
- Your name, age and sex.
- Different contact ways.
- The different languages you can speak.
- Lastly you will be selecting what your interests are.

When the setup up is complete, if you choose to be a mentor you will now just have to wait until you get a contact request from a newly arrived.
If you are a newly arrived you will se a list of mentors that you can choose to contact. The mentors you see are matched to you, they will share atleast one of your spoken languages and interests.

So get contacting!
